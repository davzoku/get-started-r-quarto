## Understanding R's read.csv vs Tidy's read_csv

There are several advantages of `read_csv` as compared to `read.csv`.

```{r}
data_dot <-read.csv("data/simple_data.csv")
data_dot
```


```{r}
data <-read_csv("data/simple_data.csv")
data
```

*Notes*:

1. In R, array indexes start at 1.
2. Notice how `read.csv` replaces spaces with dots, while in `read_csv`, you can refer to columns with spaced headers as is.
